# DECISION-TREE

### IMPLEMENTION OF DECISION TREE USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY FOR DETECTING LEAF SPECIES

- Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for Classification problems
- It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome
- It is a graphical representation for getting all the possible solutions to a problem/decision based on given conditions
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using DECISION TREE MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and tested
- Finally, the accuracy of the model is calculated
